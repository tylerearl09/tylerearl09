The basic code for this project comes from a React tutorial found here: https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
The tutorial was an introduction to React and created a tic-tac-toe game. I modified this code in order to create the 
Connect 4 game and implemented a high score table as well.

##MERN stack web app
# Speed Game

This was a group project I worked on. I helped with the authentication for the login, i.e. using a SHA256 hash in addition to a salt for the password.
I also helped to implement the card shuffling logic and implementing the rules for play.
